# [MEDIUM-1] SafeTransfer should be used in place of transfer
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 SafeTransfer should be used in place of Transfer for Solidity contracts to ensure robust security and error handling. Unlike the basic Transfer function, SafeTransfer incorporates safeguards against potential smart contract vulnerabilities, such as unexpected token loss. By automatically validating the recipient's ability to receive tokens and reverting transactions in case of failures,

# [MEDIUM-3] Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 The below-listed functions use `transferFrom()` to move funds from the sender to the recipient but fail to verify if the received token amount matches the transferred amount. This could pose an issue with fee-on-transfer tokens, where the post-transfer balance might be less than anticipated, leading to balance inconsistencies. There might be subsequent checks for a second transfer, but an attacker might exploit leftover funds (such as those accidentally sent by another user) to gain unjustified credit. A practical solution is to gauge the balance prior and post-transfer, and consider the differential as the transferred amount, instead of the predefined amount.

# [MEDIUM-4] Gas grief possible on unsafe external calls 
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, the use of low-level `call` methods can expose contracts to gas griefing attacks. The potential problem arises when the callee contract returns a large amount of data. This data is allocated in the memory of the calling contract, which pays for the gas costs. If the callee contract intentionally returns an enormous amount of data, the gas costs can skyrocket, causing the transaction to fail due to an Out of Gas error. Therefore, it's advisable to limit the use of `call` when interacting with untrusted contracts, or ensure that the callee's returned data size is capped or known in advance to prevent unexpected high gas costs.

# [MEDIUM-5] Return values of transfer()/transferFrom() not checked
## Number of instances found
 4 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, it's crucial to check the return value of `.transfer` and `.transferFrom` methods because not all ERC20 token implementations revert on failure. Notably, If these methods fail silently and the contract doesn't verify their return value, the contract might continue execution as if the tokens were transferred successfully, leading to incorrect balances, loss of funds, or other unexpected behaviors. Therefore, the return values of these methods should always be checked, ensuring a failed token transfer operation correctly halts the execution of the contract.

# [MEDIUM-6] Some tokens may revert when zero value transfers are made
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Reason: In Solidity, ERC20 token transfers of value 0 can sometimes lead to unexpected issues. This is particularly relevant when dealing with fractional token amounts that round to 0 when less than 1 of the smallest unit is transferred, leading to an effective transfer of nothing while still consuming gas. Furthermore, some ERC20 token implementations may revert on attempts to transfer a value of 0. However, note that this issue doesn't generally apply to wrapper native tokens like WETH.

Resolution: It's advisable to include a condition before any transfer operation to bypass the transaction if the transfer amount is 0. This saves unnecessary gas expenditure and prevents potential function reverts. For handling fractions, ensure token decimals are appropriately assigned and contemplate setting a minimum transfer threshold to avoid rounding down to 0. When dealing with wrapped tokens like WETH, special consideration should be given to their unique characteristics.

# [MEDIUM-7] Remaining eth may not be refunded to users
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 When a contract function accepts Ethereum and executes a `.call()` or similar function that also forwards Ethereum value, it's important to check for and refund any remaining balance. This is because some of the supplied value may not be used during the call execution due to gas constraints, a revert in the called contract, or simply because not all the value was needed.

If you do not account for this remaining balance, it can become "locked" in the contract. It's crucial to either return the remaining balance to the sender or handle it in a way that ensures it is not permanently stuck. Neglecting to do so can lead to loss of funds and degradation of the contract's reliability. Furthermore, it's good practice to ensure fairness and trust with your users by returning unused funds.

# [MEDIUM-8] Function which returns data from a call has no validation
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, when `call` or `delegatecall` is used to interact with another contract, it's possible that the called contract function doesn't return any data. This could be due to various reasons, such as the function is not implemented, or the function encountered an error. If the calling contract then tries to directly access elements in the returned data without first checking the length of the returned data, it could lead to a runtime error, or in some cases, incorrect logic execution.

Therefore, it's advisable to have a length check and revert the transaction if `results.length` is 0. This ensures the function doesn't proceed with potentially unsafe or invalid data. It also provides a clear error message to the caller, indicating that the called function did not return any data, which assists in troubleshooting.

# [MEDIUM-9] Polygon chain reorgs affect Chainlink randomness 
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 The requestConfirmations value in VRFv2Consumer is currently set to a low number. This value is critical as it communicates to the Chainlink VRF service the minimum number of blocks to wait before providing randomness. Its purpose is to mitigate the impact of chain reorganizations, events where block and transaction orders are rearranged, thus changing their output. This issue is particularly relevant for applications slated for deployment on Polygon, as referenced in the README.md, given the frequency and depth of reorganizations on this network, often exceeding 3 blocks. Even more alarmingly, a recent event revealed a chain reorganization on Polygon with a depth of 156 blocks. This scenario could lead to the possibility of changing the winner of a lootbox game. If a transaction requesting randomness from VRF is displaced to a different block due to a reorganization, the resultant randomness would also change. Hence, it may be prudent to revisit and adjust the REQUEST_CONFIRMATION constant to a higher value to ensure consistent and accurate outcomes.

# [LOW-6] Double type casts create complexity within the code
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Double type casting should be avoided in Solidity contracts to prevent unintended consequences and ensure accurate data representation. Performing multiple type casts in succession can lead to unexpected truncation, rounding errors, or loss of precision, potentially compromising the contract's functionality and reliability. Furthermore, double type casting can make the code less readable and harder to maintain, increasing the likelihood of errors and misunderstandings during development and debugging. To ensure precise and consistent data handling, developers should use appropriate data types and avoid unnecessary or excessive type casting, promoting a more robust and dependable contract execution.

# [LOW-7] Use SafeCast to safely downcast variables
## Number of instances found
 9 

## Resolution
 Downcasting int/uints in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior. When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (e.g., uint256 to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type, leading to truncation and loss of significant digits. This data loss can result in unexpected state changes, incorrect calculations, or other contract vulnerabilities, ultimately compromising the contracts functionality and reliability. To prevent these risks, developers should carefully consider the range of values their variables may hold and ensure that proper checks are in place to prevent out-of-range values before performing downcasting. Also consider using OZ SafeCast functionality.

# [LOW-9] Function calls within for loops
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Making function calls or external calls within loops in Solidity can lead to inefficient gas usage, potential bottlenecks, and increased vulnerability to attacks. Each function call or external call consumes gas, and when executed within a loop, the gas cost multiplies, potentially causing the transaction to run out of gas or exceed block gas limits. This can result in transaction failure or unpredictable behavior.

## Resolution
 In Solidity, for loops can potentially cause Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if not handled carefully. DoS attacks can occur when an attacker intentionally exploits the gas cost of a function, causing it to run out of gas or making it too expensive for other users to call. Below are some scenarios where for loops can lead to DoS attacks: Nested for loops can become exceptionally gas expensive and should be used sparingly

# [LOW-11] Unbounded state variable arrays exist within the project which are iterated upon 
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Unbounded arrays in Solidity can cause gas-related issues due to their potential for excessive growth, leading to increased computational complexity and resource consumption. Since Ethereum's gas fees are determined by the amount of computational effort required to execute a transaction, operations involving large, unbounded arrays can result in prohibitively high costs for users. Additionally, if a function iterates over an unbounded array, it may exceed the gas limit set by the network, causing the transaction to fail. To avoid these issues, developers should use bounded arrays or alternative data structures like mappings, ensuring efficient resource management and a better user experience.

# [LOW-12] Contracts do not use their OZ upgradable counterparts
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Using the upgradeable counterpart of the OpenZeppelin (OZ) library in Solidity is beneficial for creating contracts that can be updated in the future. OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library is designed with proxy patterns in mind, which allow the logic of contracts to be upgraded while preserving the contract's state and address. This can be crucial for long-lived contracts where future requirements or improvements may not be fully known at the time of deployment. The upgradeable OZ contracts also include protection against a class of vulnerabilities related to initialization of storage variables in upgradeable contracts. Hence, it's a good idea to use them when developing contracts that may need to be upgraded in the future, as they provide a solid foundation for secure and upgradeable smart contracts.

# [LOW-13] Loss of precision
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 Dividing by large numbers in Solidity can cause a loss of precision due to the language's inherent integer division behavior. Solidity does not support floating-point arithmetic, and as a result, division between integers yields an integer result, truncating any fractional part. When dividing by a large number, the resulting value may become significantly smaller, leading to a loss of precision, as the fractional part is discarded.

# [LOW-14] Missing zero address check in constructor
## Number of instances found
 9 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, constructors often take address parameters to initialize important components of a contract, such as owner or linked contracts. However, without a check, there's a risk that an address parameter could be mistakenly set to the zero address (0x0). This could occur due to a mistake or oversight during contract deployment. A zero address in a crucial role can cause serious issues, as it cannot perform actions like a normal address, and any funds sent to it are irretrievable. Therefore, it's crucial to include a zero address check in constructors to prevent such potential problems. If a zero address is detected, the constructor should revert the transaction.

# [LOW-15] Use of onlyOwner functions can be lost
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, renouncing ownership of a contract essentially transfers ownership to the zero address. This is an irreversible operation and has considerable security implications. If the renounceOwnership function is used, the contract will lose the ability to perform any operations that are limited to the owner. This can be problematic if there are any bugs, flaws, or unexpected events that require owner intervention to resolve. Therefore, in some instances, it is better to disable or omit the renounceOwnership function, and instead implement a secure transferOwnership function. This way, if necessary, ownership can be transferred to a new, trusted party without losing the potential for administrative intervention.

# [LOW-16] Using zero as a parameter
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Taking 0 as a valid argument in Solidity without checks can lead to severe security issues. A historical example is the infamous 0x0 address bug where numerous tokens were lost. This happens because '0' can be interpreted as an uninitialized address, leading to transfers to the '0x0' address, effectively burning tokens. Moreover, 0 as a denominator in division operations would cause a runtime exception. It's also often indicative of a logical error in the caller's code. It's important to always validate input and handle edge cases like 0 appropriately. Use `require()` statements to enforce conditions and provide clear error messages to facilitate debugging and safer code.

# [LOW-18] Arrays can grow in size without a way to shrink them
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 It's a good practice to maintain control over the size of array state variables in Solidity, especially if they are dynamically updated. If a contract includes a mechanism to push items into an array, it should ideally also provide a mechanism to remove items. This is because Solidity arrays don't automatically shrink when items are deleted - their length needs to be manually adjusted.

Ignoring this can lead to bloated and inefficient contracts. For instance, iterating over a large array can cause your contract to hit the block gas limit. Additionally, if entries are only marked for deletion but never actually removed, you may end up dealing with stale or irrelevant data, which can cause logical errors.

Therefore, implementing a method to 'pop' items from arrays helps manage contract's state, improve efficiency and prevent potential issues related to gas limits or stale data. Always ensure to handle potential underflow conditions when popping elements from the array.

# [LOW-19] Functions calling contracts/addresses with transfer hooks are missing reentrancy guards
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 While adherence to the check-effects-interaction pattern is commendable, the absence of a reentrancy guard in functions, especially where transfer hooks might be present, can expose the protocol users to risks of read-only reentrancies. Such reentrancy vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute malicious actions even without altering the contract state. Without a reentrancy guard, the only potential mitigation would be to blocklist the entire protocol - an extreme and disruptive measure. Therefore, incorporating a reentrancy guard into these functions is vital to bolster security, as it helps protect against both traditional reentrancy attacks and read-only reentrancies, ensuring robust and safe protocol operations.

# [LOW-20] Revert on Transfer to the Zero Address
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Many ERC-20 and ERC-721 token contracts implement a safeguard that reverts transactions which attempt to transfer tokens to the zero address. This is because such transfers are often the result of programming errors. The OpenZeppelin library, a popular choice for implementing these standards, includes this safeguard. For token contract developers who want to avoid unintentional transfers to the zero address, it's good practice to include a condition that reverts the transaction if the recipient's address is the zero address.

# [LOW-21] Constructors contains no validation
## Number of instances found
 4 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, when values are being assigned in constructors to unsigned or integer variables, it's crucial to ensure the provided values adhere to the protocol's specific operational boundaries as laid out in the project specifications and documentation. If the constructors lack appropriate validation checks, there's a risk of setting state variables with values that could cause unexpected and potentially detrimental behavior within the contract's operations, violating the intended logic of the protocol. This can compromise the contract's security and impact the maintainability and reliability of the system. In order to avoid such issues, it is recommended to incorporate rigorous validation checks in constructors. These checks should align with the project's defined rules and constraints, making use of Solidity's built-in require function to enforce these conditions. If the validation checks fail, the require function will cause the transaction to revert, ensuring the integrity and adherence to the protocol's expected behavior.

# [NC-2] Empty function blocks
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Empty code blocks (i.e., {}) in a Solidity contract can be harmful as they can lead to ambiguity, misinterpretation, and unintended behavior. When developers encounter empty code blocks, it may be unclear whether the absence of code is intentional or the result of an oversight. This uncertainty can cause confusion during development, testing, and debugging, increasing the likelihood of introducing errors or vulnerabilities. Moreover, empty code blocks may give a false impression of implemented functionality or security measures, creating a misleading sense of assurance. To ensure clarity and maintainability, it is essential to avoid empty code blocks and explicitly document the intended behavior or any intentional omissions.

# [NC-15] Function names should differ to make the code more readable
## Number of instances found
 10 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, while function overriding allows for functions with the same name to coexist, it is advisable to avoid this practice to enhance code readability and maintainability. Having multiple functions with the same name, even with different parameters or in inherited contracts, can cause confusion and increase the likelihood of errors during development, testing, and debugging. Using distinct and descriptive function names not only clarifies the purpose and behavior of each function, but also helps prevent unintended function calls or incorrect overriding. By adopting a clear and consistent naming convention, developers can create more comprehensible and maintainable smart contracts.

# [NC-24] Constants should be on the left side of the 
## Number of instances found
 14 

## Resolution
 Putting constants on the left side of a comparison operator like `==` or `<` is a best practice known as "Yoda conditions", which can help prevent accidental assignment instead of comparison. In some programming languages, if a variable is mistakenly put on the left with a single `=` instead of `==`, it assigns the constant's value to the variable without any compiler error. However, doing this with the constant on the left would generate an error, as constants cannot be assigned values. Although Solidity's static typing system prevents accidental assignments within conditionals, adopting this practice enhances code readability and consistency, especially when developers are working across multiple languages that support this convention.

 Allowing a function in Solidity to return the default address (address(0)) can be problematic as it can represent uninitialized or invalid addresses. If such an address is utilized in transfer operations or other sensitive actions, it could lead to loss of funds or unpredicted behavior. It's prudent to include checks in your functions to prevent the return of the zero address, enhancing contract security.

# [NC-28] Critical functions should be a two step procedure
## Number of instances found
 5 

## Resolution
 Critical functions in Solidity contracts should follow a two-step procedure to enhance security, minimize human error, and ensure proper access control. By dividing sensitive operations into distinct phases, such as initiation and confirmation, developers can introduce a safeguard against unintended actions or unauthorized access.

# [NC-31] Consider adding emergency-stop functionality
## Number of instances found
 11 

## Resolution
 In the event of a security breach or any unforeseen emergency, swiftly suspending all protocol operations becomes crucial. Having a mechanism in place to halt all functions collectively, instead of pausing individual contracts separately, substantially enhances the efficiency of mitigating ongoing attacks or vulnerabilities. This not only quickens the response time to potential threats but also reduces operational stress during these critical periods. Therefore, consider integrating a 'circuit breaker' or 'emergency stop' function into the smart contract system architecture. Such a feature would provide the capability to suspend the entire protocol instantly, which could prove invaluable during a time-sensitive crisis management situation.

# [NC-32] Remove forge-std import
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Logging and debugging libraries such as forge-std are crucial tools during the development phase of a smart contract, as they provide critical insights into the execution of the contract. However, it's essential to remove or disable these libraries in the production version of your contract. Leaving such libraries active in the final version can lead to unnecessary gas costs, as logging operations consume gas, and it can potentially expose sensitive internal state information.

# [NC-33] Some if-statement can be converted to a ternary
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 Improving code readability and compactness is an integral part of optimal programming practices. The use of ternary operators in place of if-else conditions is one such measure. Ternary operators allow us to write conditional statements in a more concise manner, thereby enhancing readability and simplicity. They follow the syntax `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`, which interprets as "if the condition is true, evaluate to `exprIfTrue`, else evaluate to `exprIfFalse`". By adopting this approach, we make our code more streamlined and intuitive, which could potentially aid in better understanding and maintenance of the codebase.

# [NC-36] Empty bytes check is missing
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 When developing smart contracts in Solidity, it's crucial to validate the inputs of your functions. This includes ensuring that the bytes parameters are not empty, especially when they represent crucial data such as addresses, identifiers, or raw data that the contract needs to process.

Missing empty bytes checks can lead to unexpected behaviour in your contract. For instance, certain operations might fail, produce incorrect results, or consume unnecessary gas when performed with empty bytes. Moreover, missing input validation can potentially expose your contract to malicious activity, including exploitation of unhandled edge cases.

To mitigate these issues, always validate that bytes parameters are not empty when the logic of your contract requires it.

# [NC-37] It's not standard to end and begin a code object on the same line
## Number of instances found
 36 

## Resolution
 Placing the closing and opening brackets of distinct code blocks on the same line can impair code readability and clarity, leading to potential misinterpretations. To improve maintainability and reduce the chances of introducing errors, it is advisable to start each code block on a new line, making the boundaries between different code sections clearer and easier to discern unless it is an else statement.

# [NC-43] Assembly code blocks should be thoroughly commented
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, assembly blocks are often harder to read and understand due to their low-level nature. Detailed comments can make the code's purpose and functionality clear, aiding in maintenance, debugging, and reviews. Moreover, comments can be crucial for auditors and other developers to understand the contract's security implications, reducing the risk of oversights and vulnerabilities.

# [NC-45] Do not use underscore at the end of variable name
## Number of instances found
 5 

## Resolution
 Adopting a consistent and clear naming convention enhances code readability and maintainability. In Solidity, appending an underscore at the end of a variable name is unconventional and can lead to confusion. It is generally advisable to stick to accepted naming practices to promote ease of understanding and use.

# [NC-46] Consider using SMTChecker
## Number of instances found
 17 

## Resolution
 The SMTChecker is a valuable tool for Solidity developers as it helps detect potential vulnerabilities and logical errors in the contract's code. By utilizing Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, it can reason about the potential states a contract can be in, and therefore, identify conditions that could lead to undesirable behavior. This automatic formal verification can catch issues that might otherwise be missed in manual code reviews or standard testing, enhancing the overall contract's security and reliability.

# [NC-47] Contracts should have full test coverage
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Attaining 100% code coverage is not an assurance of a bug-free codebase, but it significantly improves the likelihood of identifying simple bugs and aids in maintaining a stable codebase by preventing regressions during code modifications. Additionally, to achieve complete coverage, code writers usually have to structure their code more modularly, which implies testing each component independently. This reduces the complex interdependencies between modules and layers, creating a more understandable and auditable codebase. Consequently, this practice aids in enhancing code maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing bugs during future changes.

# [NC-48] Consider using SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH() or Address.sendValue() for clearer semantic meaning
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 For improved code readability and better semantic understanding, it's recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH() or Address.sendValue(). These functions explicitly describe their operation with their naming convention, increasing the comprehensibility of the code. Their usage over lower-level calls enhances the maintainability of your smart contract code by clearly indicating the purpose of the function.

# [GAS-1] It is more efficient to use block.timestamp directly rather than calling a function to return it
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Creating a function to return block.timestamp is gas inefficient due to the overhead of function storage and execution, while directly accessing block.timestamp in your contract code or as a function argument is a more gas-efficient alternative.

# [GAS-9] Usage of smaller uint/int types causes overhead
## Number of instances found
 42 

## Resolution
 When using a smaller int/uint type it first needs to be converted to it's 258 bit counterpart to be operated, this increases the gass cost and thus should be avoided. However it does make sense to use smaller int/uint values within structs provided you pack the struct properly.

# [GAS-10] Avoid updating storage when the value hasn't changed
## Number of instances found
 3 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, manipulating contract storage comes with significant gas costs. One can optimize gas usage by preventing unnecessary storage updates when the new value is the same as the existing one. If an existing value is the same as the new one, not reassigning it to the storage could potentially save substantial amounts of gas, notably 2900 gas for a 'Gsreset'. This saving may come at the expense of a cold storage load operation ('Gcoldsload'), which costs 2100 gas, or a warm storage access operation ('Gwarmaccess'), which costs 100 gas. Therefore, the gas efficiency of your contract can be significantly improved by adding a check that compares the new value with the current one before any storage update operation. If the values are the same, you can bypass the storage operation, thereby saving gas.

# [GAS-17] Use assembly to check for the zero address
## Number of instances found
 5 

## Resolution
 
Using assembly for address comparisons in Solidity can save gas because it allows for more direct access to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), reducing the overhead of higher-level operations. Solidity's high-level abstraction simplifies coding but can introduce additional gas costs. Using assembly for simple operations like address comparisons can be more gas-efficient.

# [GAS-18] Use storage instead of memory for structs/arrays
## Number of instances found
 3 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, using storage instead of memory for structs and arrays in function parameters can result in gas savings. When data is passed as a storage reference, the function operates directly on the original data stored in contract storage, without needing to create a copy. Conversely, when memory is used, a copy of the data is created, which incurs additional gas costs. However, it's essential to note that while using storage references can save gas, it also means that any changes made to the data inside the function will modify the original data stored in the contract, which may not always be the desired behavior. Therefore, developers should carefully consider the implications of using storage versus memory based on the specific requirements of their functions.

# [GAS-19] Can transfer 0
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 In Solidity, performing unnecessary operations can consume more gas than needed, leading to cost inefficiencies. For instance, if a `transfer` function doesn't have a zero amount check and someone calls it with a zero amount, unnecessary gas will be consumed in executing the function, even though the state of the contract remains the same. By implementing a zero amount check, such unnecessary function calls can be avoided, thereby saving gas and making the contract more efficient.

# [GAS-23] Don't use _msgSender() if not supporting EIP-2771
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 From a gas efficiency perspective, using `_msgSender()` in a contract not intended to support EIP-2771 could add unnecessary overhead. The `_msgSender()` function includes checks to determine if the transaction was forwarded, which involves extra function calls that consume more gas than a simple `msg.sender`.

If a contract doesn't require EIP-2771 meta-transaction support, using `msg.sender` directly is more gas efficient. `msg.sender` is a globally accessible variable in Solidity that doesn't require an extra function call, making it a less costly choice.

In the context of Ethereum, where every operation has a gas cost, it's crucial to eliminate unnecessary computations to optimize contract execution and minimize transaction fees. Therefore, if EIP-2771 support isn't necessary, it's recommended to use `msg.sender` instead of `_msgSender()`.

# [GAS-24] Unbounded Gas Consumption Risk Due to External Call Recipients
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 In the context of Solidity, external function calls without a specified gas limit present a significant risk. The callee contract has the potential to consume all the gas allocated to the transaction, causing an undesired revert and disrupt the function's execution. To mitigate this, it's recommended to explicitly set a gas limit when performing external calls using addr.call{gas: <amount>}. This limits the gas forwarded to the callee, preventing potential pitfalls and offering better control over transaction execution.

# [GAS-25] Consider activating via-ir for deploying
## Number of instances found
 17 

## Resolution
 The Solidity compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR) based code generator, which can be activated using --via-ir on the command line or {"viaIR": true} in the options, serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it boosts the transparency and audibility of code generation, which enhances developers' comprehension and control over the contract's final bytecode. Secondly, it enables more sophisticated optimization passes that span multiple functions, thereby potentially leading to more efficient bytecode.

It's important to note that using the IR-based code generator may lengthen compile times due to the extra optimization steps. Therefore, it's advised to test your contract with and without this option enabled to measure the performance and gas cost implications. If the IR-based code generator significantly enhances your contract's performance or reduces gas costs, consider using the --via-ir flag during deployment. This way, you can leverage more advanced compiler optimizations without hindering your development workflow.

# [GAS-26] The result of a function call should be cached rather than re-calling the function
## Number of instances found
 19 

## Resolution
 External calls in Solidity are costly in terms of gas usage. This can significantly impact contract efficiency and cost. Functions that make repetitive calls to fetch the same data from other contracts can cause unnecessary gas expenditure. To optimize this, it's advisable to store the returned value of these function calls in a state variable, essentially caching the data. This data can be updated at regular intervals or under specific conditions instead of fetching it from the external contract on every invocation. Be sure to analyze the frequency of data change in the external contract to balance data freshness with gas efficiency when implementing caching.

# [GAS-28] Add unchecked {} for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow
## Number of instances found
 3 

## Resolution
 n Solidity 0.8.x and above, arithmetic operations like subtraction automatically check for underflows and overflows, and revert the transaction if such a condition is met. This built-in safety feature provides a layer of security against potential numerical errors. However, these automatic checks also come with additional gas costs.

In some situations, you may already have a guard condition, like a require() statement or an if statement, that ensures the safety of the arithmetic operation. In such cases, the automatic check becomes redundant and leads to unnecessary gas expenditure.

For example, you may have a function that subtracts a smaller number from a larger one, and you may have already verified that the smaller number is indeed smaller. In this case, you're already sure that the subtraction operation won't underflow, so there's no need for the automatic check.

In these situations, you can use the unchecked { } block around the subtraction operation to skip the automatic check. This will reduce gas costs and make your contract more efficient, without sacrificing security. However, it's critical to use unchecked { } only when you're absolutely sure that the operation is safe.

# [GAS-29] Use bitmap to save gas
## Number of instances found
 1 

## Resolution
 Bitmaps in Solidity are essentially a way of representing a set of boolean values within an integer type variable such as `uint256`. Each bit in the integer represents a true or false value (1 or 0), thus allowing efficient storage of multiple boolean values.

Bitmaps can save gas in the Ethereum network because they condense a lot of information into a small amount of storage. In Ethereum, storage is one of the most significant costs in terms of gas usage. By reducing the amount of storage space needed, you can potentially save on gas fees.

Here's a quick comparison:

If you were to represent 256 different boolean values in the traditional way, you would have to declare 256 different `bool` variables. Given that each `bool` occupies a storage slot and each storage slot costs 20,000 gas to initialize, you would end up paying a considerable amount of gas.

On the other hand, if you were to use a bitmap, you could store these 256 boolean values within a single `uint256` variable. In other words, you'd only pay for a single storage slot, resulting in significant gas savings.

However, it's important to note that while bitmaps can provide gas efficiencies, they do add complexity to the code, making it harder to read and maintain. Also, using bitmaps is efficient only when dealing with a large number of boolean variables that are frequently changed or accessed together. 

In contrast, the straightforward counterpart to bitmaps would be using arrays or mappings to store boolean values, with each `bool` value occupying its own storage slot. This approach is simpler and more readable but could potentially be more expensive in terms of gas usage.

# [GAS-30] Use assembly to emit events
## Number of instances found
 17 

## Resolution
 With the use of inline assembly in Solidity, we can take advantage of low-level features like scratch space and the free memory pointer, offering more gas-efficient ways of emitting events. The scratch space is a certain area of memory where we can temporarily store data, and the free memory pointer indicates the next available memory slot. Using these, we can efficiently assemble event data without incurring additional memory expansion costs. However, safety is paramount: to avoid overwriting or leakage, we must cache the free memory pointer before use and restore it afterward, ensuring that it points to the correct memory location post-operation.

# [GAS-31] Shorten the array rather than copying to a new one
## Number of instances found
 2 

## Resolution
 Leveraging inline assembly in Solidity provides the ability to directly manipulate the length slot of an array, thereby altering its length without the need to copy the elements to a new array of the desired size. This technique is more gas-efficient as it avoids the computational expense associated with array duplication. However, this method circumvents the type-checking and safety mechanisms of high-level Solidity and should be used judiciously. Always ensure that the array doesn't contain vital data beyond the revised length, as this data will become unreachable yet still consume storage space.

@Brendan üåäüèÜ 
If I understand this correctly, 
Vaults can be deployed in which users can deposit their ERC20 tokens. These tokens accrue yield (how?). Then the yield is liquidated (by who?). 
This yield is sold for POOL tokens. The POOL tokens are added to the prize pool. And Vaults claim the prizes on behalf of depositors.


[08/03/2023 10:56] _3agle
Also can you provide more context on VaultBooster


[08/03/2023 11:16] plamkata
If I remember correctly from the last contest, they use an outside yield vault, they do not do the accruing. Correct me if I am wrong, I am not at home rn @Brendan üåäüèÜ @Pierrick


[08/03/2023 14:01] asselstine
Yes; our vaults wrap other 4626 vaults and turn the yield into prizes


[08/03/2023 14:02] asselstine
It allow us to subsidize a vault by liquidating any arbitrary token and contributing the POOL to the prize pool on a vaults behalf


[08/03/2023 14:20] plamkata

[08/03/2023 18:04] debofx
Yes, one of many is: Prb-math solidity files do not match. For instance "prb-math/ud8..sol" is the import path. But when you clone the import path is actually "../../prb-math/src/ud8..sol"


[08/03/2023 18:07] asselstine
I just did a fresh clone of the audit repo, ran `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then ran `forge test` in each repo and everything worked

[08/03/2023 19:53] pierrickgt
Have you ran `forge install`?
I've cloned the repo, cd into it, ran `forge install` then `forge test` and it ran without any problem.


[08/03/2023 19:54] pierrickgt
Which forge version are you running?


[08/03/2023 20:02] 0xarz
hey, stupid question but whats the tokenIn and tokenOut in the LiquidationPair?


[08/03/2023 20:08] pierrickgt
`tokenIn` is the token being liquidated, in our case the POOL token, in exchange of `tokenOut` which corresponds to the Vault shares.
In summary, yield is being liquidated in exchange of POOL tokens.


[08/03/2023 20:12] plamkata
Wait so it should be the other way around


[08/03/2023 20:12] plamkata
You are liquidating vault yield for pool


[08/03/2023 20:12] plamkata
So tokenIn is the vault shares, tokenOut is the Pool


[08/03/2023 20:13] pierrickgt
This diagram should help you understand how it works.
The liquidator calls `swapExactAmountOut` on the LiquidationRouter, POOL tokens are sent to the PrizePool then `liquidate` is called on the Vault.
POOL tokens are then contributed for the current draw and vault shares are minted to the liquidator.

[08/03/2023 20:15] pierrickgt
No, it's the other way around.
It will revert if `tokenOut` is not the Vault address or if `tokenIn` is not the Prize Token, in our case POOL.

[08/03/2023 21:31] 0xarz
and POOL is the yield the users get from depositing tokens into the vault?


[08/03/2023 21:33] pierrickgt
Yes, POOL is the token the user receives if he wins a prize


[08/03/2023 21:36] 0xarz
i get that but the user needs POOL to call swapExactAmountOut() right? where does he get POOL if he has never won before?


[08/03/2023 21:39] pierrickgt
Exactly. Liquidators are sophisticated actors that will arbitrage a price discrepancy between POOL and Vault shares.
They can acquire POOL via Uniswap for example.


[08/03/2023 21:40] 0xarz
makes sense, thanks a lot!


[08/04/2023 05:23] _3agle
So a user sends POOL tokens to get Vault shares in return
On the other hand, the users can also supply ERC20 tokens to the vault to receive Vault shares??


[08/04/2023 05:56] _3agle
In this image, does liquidator mean "liquidation pair"?

also when they send pool tokens while liquidation, they recieve vault shares, right?

in what cases is the direct one used, and in what cases is the remote one used tho?


[08/05/2023 16:19] pierrickgt
The direct one is used when you want to relay on the same chain.
The remote one is used when you want to relay from L1 to an L2 chain.


[08/05/2023 16:23] 0xarz
i see, ty! is the direct one ever going to be used then?

I ran this command `git clone https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-pooltogether.git --recurse`

Try without `--recurse` and run `forge install` in each subfolders.
`pt-v5-cgda-liquidator` imports a lot of dependencies from ERC5164, that's mainly why it can be slow to clone.

For anyone having issues cloning the repository from the contest.
If you clone the repo without `--recurse`, it will not initialize the sub git folders.
So for each repo, you need to run `git submodule update --init --remote pt-v5-draw-auction` to pull the repo and then you can `cd` into it and run `forge install`.

Can I tweet about a vulnerability or I got wait until the report will be out?


[08/18/2023 23:37] cloudellie
You can discuss the awarding results but no discussion of the vulns themselves until the report is out. Report going public is the best signal that the project team has mitigated all findings.
